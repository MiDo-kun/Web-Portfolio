## What I've Learned

Throughout this project, I have gained valuable experience in several key areas of front-end development. Specifically, I have learned how to:

- Effectively use color palettes and fonts to create visually appealing designs.
- Utilize the Tailwind CSS framework to target accurate media queries and achieve better responsive design.
- Retrieve data from GitHub Gists using the fetch() API for dynamic access to data.

Overall, these skills have helped me become a more proficient front-end developer and have prepared me for future projects in the field.
